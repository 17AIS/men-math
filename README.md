A program like zetmac, but trying to build it for both web and android devices (by creating an apk).

How the program works (or is going to work):

1. on the main page, you would have some parameter adjusting element, in which you'd choose the operations and range that you would want the numbers to be in 

2. the webpage itself should verify if the numbers are valid, and give appropriate errors when the instructions are not followed

3. when successful, have a js compile questions that are in the range provided, and make 5 question for every second the user requests 

4. prompt them into a new screen, (potentially lagless), where they would be given questions, and you would write the answer

5. without having to press enter, if the answer in the box is correct, it should clear the box and move onto the next question

6. after the questions are all over, if it is in the top 10, then it should be displayed on the scoreboard, with a timestamp (cahced, not stored anywhere)

7. potential wiping of the leaderboard.
